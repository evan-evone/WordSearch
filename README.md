# WordSearch with Python
### Because you either love word searches or you hate them

WordSearch is made to solve word searches. In the future, it may also be able to make word searches and let
you play them, if you fancy that. Right now, all that's here is the one file that can find a single word in
a word search file. A lot of work needs to be done.

### Arguments (That Need to be Implemented)

- `-d`: Already implemented, debug feature. Does a lot of print statements. Standalone, can be anywhere.
- `-i`: Specify input file.
- `-o`: Specify output file.
- `-w`: Specify a file containing the words to be found.
- `-s`: Specify stdin/stdout. Default.
